According to the authors of **Maize tassel detection** dataset, the timing of flowering profoundly impacts crop productivity in agriculture, as early flowering can lead to premature maturation and late flowering may result in season-related damage. Maize, in particular, is highly sensitive during its flowering stage. The study this dataset was created for focuses on the development and comparison of two deep learning-based methods for automatic tassel detection using imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles.
