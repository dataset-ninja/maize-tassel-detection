**Maize Tassel Detection From UAV Imagery Using Deep Learning** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 776 images with 3553 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class different classes (*tassels*).

Images in the Maize Tassel Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 101 (13% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2021 by the Dryad.
